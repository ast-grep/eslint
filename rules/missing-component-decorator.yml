note: |
  This rule checks for Angular lifecycle methods like `ngOnInit` or `ngOnDestroy` in classes that do not have the `@Component()` decorator. It helps ensure that Angular components are properly defined.
  If you encounter this warning, consider adding the `@Component()` decorator to the class to ensure it is recognized as an Angular component.
  If the class is not intended to be an Angular component, you may want to rename the lifecycle methods to avoid confusion.
